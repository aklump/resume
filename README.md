# Aaron Klump's Resume

> My aim right now is to show you why the resume you hold in your hand should not be forgotten.  In this tiny code repo I will back the skills and claims I've just made to you.  I ask you to take a minute to review these pages so that you might have a better glimpse of my ability to excel in this position.

## Goals

This code base demonstrates my understanding of the following:

- Separation of [data from presentation](install/data/base).
- Manipulation of data [using PHP](src/AKlump/Resume/Builder.php) to make it API-ready.
- Use of a [(Twig) template](themes/aklump/templates) engine to generate markup from the API-ready data.
- Style markup using [SMACSS and SCSS](themes/aklump/sass/components/_contact.scss) for both print and screen
- How to [document an app](USAGE.md) for better user experience.
