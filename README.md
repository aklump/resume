# Aaron Klump's Resume Addendum

This code repository holds the app that I built to generate my resume, which I'm assuming you have recently reviewed.

I ask you to to take the next 60 seconds to click on the 5 links below, which will demonstrate and back the skills that I've listed out in my resume.

My hope is that your impression one minute from now is that you would like to give me a call to discuss this position.

## Let's Begin the Demonstration...

Each link below is an entry point into one concept integral to web development.  Feel free to browse the repository, but use these links as guides into each topic.

- Separation of [data from presentation](install/data/base).
- Manipulation of data [using PHP](src/AKlump/Resume/Builder.php) to make it API-ready.
- Use of a [(Twig) template](themes/aklump/templates) engine to generate markup from the API-ready data.
- Style markup using [SMACSS and SCSS](themes/aklump/sass/components/_contact.scss) for both print and screen.
- How to [document an app](USAGE.md) for better user adoption and experience.

Thank you for your consideration,

Aaron Klump
